Developers should always do the best they can to stay up to date on the latest tech happenings. The field evolves very quickly! Surveying the technology landscape is very important and can even be done daily.

La veille technologique est un moment indispensable du quotidien
Stay up to date in your field!
Good developers regularly check in on the news in their field -- every day, not every week or month! In order to stay up to date, you will need to do the following in order to create your own dashboard: 

1. List out the technologies in which you're interested.
2. List out some news sites where you could find tech-related news.
3. Create a dashboard that will help you stay up to date (for example a dashboard on Feedly), including the latest updates from the sites you listed above. 
4. Create a Twitter account (if you don't already have one) and follow different influencers in the world of web development.
